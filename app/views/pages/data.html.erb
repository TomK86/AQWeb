      <p>Believe it or not, we actually have Consultant Auditors that enjoy the tedious job of auditing Clinical Study Reports and other documents.  Documents we have reviewed include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clinical Study Reports for format and accuracy, in comparison to the tables, listings and graphs</li>
        <li>Audits of the clinical and/or safety database in comparison to reports / submissions to FDA or other government authorities</li>
        <li>Annual reports to the Regulatory Agency</li>
        <li>Protocols and Amendments</li>
        <li>Investigator Brochures and Package Inserts</li>
        <li>Informed Consent Forms</li>
        <li>Study-specific Plans</li>
      </ul>
